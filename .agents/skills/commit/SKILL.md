description: Analyze staged git changes for this Neovim plugin, write an appropriate Conventional Commit message, and create the commit. Use ! and a BREAKING CHANGE footer for real public API breaks.

# Commit

Use this skill when the user wants the agent to inspect staged changes, come up with the right commit message, and commit them.

## Workflow

1. Inspect staged changes with:
   - `git diff --cached --stat`
   - `git diff --cached --name-only`
   - focused `git diff --cached -- <files>` when needed
2. Identify the dominant intent:
   - `feat`, `fix`, `style`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`
3. Prefer a specific scope when useful: `tools`, `diff`, `history`, `prompt`, `mentions`, `layout`, `config`, `replay`, `completion`, `dialog`, `api`, `agents`.
4. Write a concise Conventional Commit subject:
   - `type(scope): summary`
5. Use `!` only for real breaking changes to public APIs, documented commands, config, keymaps, or user-configured action names.
6. For user-facing changes, ensure `CHANGELOG.md` has a lean dated entry before committing.
7. Add a short body only when it helps, especially for renames, removed options, or migration notes.
8. Commit with `git commit`.

## Repo Guidance

Good:
- `fix(history): force scroll in set_status to keep spinner visible`
- `feat(tools): inline single-line rendering for read tool`
- `style(dialog): use title fg for dialog title instead of inverted colors`

If the change is only an internal move, do not mark it breaking.

## Changelog

This repo treats `main` as released. Keep `CHANGELOG.md` manual and lean:

```md
# Changelog

## YYYY-MM-DD

- **TAG:** User-facing change.
```

Rules:
- Add/update a date section for user-facing changes: config/API, commands, keymaps, documented behavior, compatibility, important fixes.
- Use today's local date (`date +%F`, or the current-date context if already provided) for the section; do not append to the latest existing section unless it is today's date.
- Use flat bullets only; no nested categories.
- Tags: `**BREAKING:**`, `**ADDED:**`, `**CHANGED:**`, `**FIXED:**`, `**REMOVED:**`.
- Do not add manual commit links; link issues/PRs only when they add useful context.
- Skip changelog entries for purely internal refactors, style, or docs-only changes unless they affect users.

## Breaking Changes

`!` in the subject marks the commit as breaking.

Use it when the staged change breaks a real public contract, such as a documented Lua API, command, config key, keymap, or user-configured action name.

Add a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer when the break needs explanation, migration guidance, or could be ambiguous from the subject alone.

Practical rule:
- use `!` for the signal
- use `BREAKING CHANGE:` for the explanation

Examples:

```text
refactor(api)!: rename extension ui callback contract
```

```text
refactor(api)!: rename extension ui callback contract

BREAKING CHANGE: extensions using the old callback names must be updated.
```

## Output

When asked to commit:
- state the proposed commit message briefly
- run `git commit`
- report the created commit hash

If staged changes mix unrelated concerns, say so and suggest splitting instead of forcing one bad commit.
